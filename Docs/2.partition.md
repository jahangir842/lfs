5. **Create Partitions**  
   - Use `fdisk` to create partitions on the virtual disk:
     ```bash
     fdisk /dev/sda
     ```

6. **Create the First Partition**  
   - Type `n` to create a new partition.
   - Press Enter to accept the default partition number (`1`).
   - Press Enter to accept the default first sector.
   - Type `+25G` for the size of the first partition (25GB), then press Enter.

7. **Create the Second Partition**  
   - Type `n` again to create a second partition.
   - Press Enter to accept the default partition number (`2`).
   - Press Enter to accept the default first sector.
   - Type `+4G` for the size of the second partition (4GB), then press Enter.

8. **Write the Changes**  
   - Type `w` to write the partition changes to disk, then press Enter.

9. **Verify the Partitions**  
   - To check the partitions, run the following command:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```

10. **Format the First Partition**  
   To format run the following command:

   ```bash
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
   ```

11. **Create the Swap Partition **  
   To format the second partition (`/dev/sda2`) as a swap partition, run:

   ```bash
   mkswap /dev/sda2
   ```

12. **Enable the Swap Partition**  
   Once the swap partition is formatted, activate it with:

   ```bash
   swapon /dev/sda2
   ```

13. **Verify the Partitions and Swap Status**  
   To check that the partitions are formatted correctly, run:

   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

   To confirm that swap is active, use:

   ```bash
   swapon --show
   ```

### Summary of Commands:
1. Format `/dev/sda1`:
   ```bash
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
   ```

2. Format `/dev/sda2` as swap:
   ```bash
   mkswap /dev/sda2
   ```

3. Enable the swap partition:
   ```bash
   swapon /dev/sda2
   ```

4. Check the partitions:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

These steps will format `/dev/sda1` as `ext4` for your Gentoo installation and `/dev/sda2` as swap space. Let me know if you need further clarification!
